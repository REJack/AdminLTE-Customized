This is a customized **AdminLTE** that imports **AdminLTE**'s SCSS & JS files to easily update **AdminLTE** after new updates.

Also this customized **AdminLTE** changes the default primary color (blue) to purple and increases sidebar width to 350px instead of 250px, the two most asked customizations in **AdminLTE**'s GitHub issues.
